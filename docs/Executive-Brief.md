# CyberODM — Executive Brief (Outcome‑Driven Metrics)

**Purpose:** Prove cybersecurity’s business value by tracking outcomes (Risk Reduction, Regulatory Confidence, Operational Resilience, Data Protection) and showing value realization alongside progress to targets.

**What You Get**
- Outcome Scores (0–1), RAG status, and trends
- Value Realization ($) from cost avoidance, efficiency, revenue protection
- OKR progress with on‑track/at‑risk status
- A prioritized gap list with owners & target dates

**Presenting Flow**
1) Lead with **Value Realization** and **Outcome Scores** this quarter.  
2) Show **OKR progress** and highlight at‑risk outcomes.  
3) Close with **Top 5 actions** owners & dates.

**Scoring**
Outcome Score = weighted blend of normalized KPIs (leading + lagging) vs. targets, multiplied by outcome weight. Default RAG: Red < 0.5, Amber < 0.75, Green ≥ 0.75 (configurable).
